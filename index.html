<p>This unique and life-changing fellowship promotes the values important to Bassel&#8217;s work and life: open culture, radical sharing, free knowledge, remix, collaboration, courage, optimism, and humanity.</p>

<p>Fellows are expected to lead projects or initiatives that will catalyze free culture, particularly in societies vulnerable to attacks on freedom of expression and free access to knowledge. Special consideration will be given to applicants operating within closed societies, under adverse circumstances, and in developing economies where other forms of support are scarce.</p>
